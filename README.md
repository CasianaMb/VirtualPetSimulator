# VirtualPetSimulator
This project is a simple virtual pet simulator designed to help me learn and apply software design patterns and unit testing. The pet exhibits basic behaviors such as hunger, happiness, and health, allowing interaction through feeding, playing, and resting. The primary goal is to practice clean architecture.
